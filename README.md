# Udat - a [Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com) watch face

## About

Why the name Udat? I've always loved Peter F Hamilton's books and in the Nightsdawn Trilody particularly I love the sentient spaceships.

Why a Watchy watch? I love the Apple ecosysyem, I always have. Sometimes though you need something open and hackable so you can make anything you want.

Based on the standard 7_SEG watch face example.

Adds:

- sending your daily steps to your Watchy server at the end of the day

## Getting started

Copy src/settings.h.template to src/settings.h and set the variables to your needs - there are some defaults provided for most.

Build, run and flash the watchface following the [PlatformIO instructions](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started#platformio-setup).
